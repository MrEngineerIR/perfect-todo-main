This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

if you want to test in local mode first make a .env file at the root of this project and in it make MONGO_URI key and set a proper value for it , for example : mongodb://localhost:27017

also make sure you have installed Node.js and MongoDB on your computer

then open terminal or integrated console on your IDE and :

First, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
then run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
